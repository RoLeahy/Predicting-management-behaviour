# Predicting-management-behaviour
Logistic regression models examining players' behaviour following concussion.

This analysis aimed to examine factors associated with management behaviour (i.e., continuing to play, returning to play on the same day) following a concussion.
Initially, univariate associations between individual factors (such as age and level of play) and outcomes were examined. 
Factors that were significantly (p>0.25) associated with behaviour were included in final logistic regression models.
Likelihood ratio tests compared final models with intercept-only models to examine goodness of fit.
